# Customer satisfaction monitoring system

In the context of the 2022 Team Projects Conference, InsERT submitted its own project, in partnership with
Wrocław University of Science and Technology. The initiative was named ‘’Customer satisfaction monitoring
system’’ and aimed to create a dedicated module for existing solutions of InsERT. This module was
responsible for collecting information about customer satisfaction and their current needs. Its functionalities
included creating personalized surveys, sending them to customers, and reviewing the results of the
surveys (similar to Google Forms). 

The project was carried out by a five-person team, coordinated by a
delegated InsERT employee. The final outcome of our work was presented during the Team Projects
Conference, which took place on June 23, 2022, at the Wrocław University of Science and Technology. A
promotional video of our product can be found on my portfolio on GitHub.
