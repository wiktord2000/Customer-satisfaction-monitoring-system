# Customer-satisfaction-monitoring-system
This project is implemented as Team Project for InsERT Company to pass the university course and achieve some experience with big projects where teamwork is really important. This project aims to create a web application that allows any service company to create their account and give the opportunity to create, manage and analyze the polls for their customers. The polls can be sent to the customer after service is performed for example after shoe delivery. The link to the form can be sent by e-mail via a dedicated window which allows us to add basic information like a topic of message or description. Application support handy mechanisms like import addresses from the CSV file, the possibility to change the view of displaying polls and more. To generate charts was used most popular open-source library ngx-charts framework. The backend was performed by my colleagues with the use of Django REST framework (Python) and database manager PostgreSQL. Personally, I am responsible for the frontend side and I am working in Angular framework with TypeScript language.
